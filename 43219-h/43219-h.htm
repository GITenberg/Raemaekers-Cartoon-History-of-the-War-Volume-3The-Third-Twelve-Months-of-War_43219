<p>The first official charges on the subject were issued on November 9 at
Havre by Baron Beyens, Belgian Foreign Minister, as follows:</p>

<p>"The German Government is rounding up in large numbers in the towns and
villages of occupied Belgium, such as Alost, Ghent, Bruges, Courtrai,
and Mons,&mdash;to name only the first to be victims of the measures,&mdash;all
men fit to bear arms, rich and poor, irrespective of class, whether
employed or unemployed, hunchbacks, cripples, and one-armed men alone
are excepted. These men are torn in thousands from their families;
fifteen thousand from Flanders alone are sent God knows where. Whole
trainloads are seen going east and south."</p>

<h4>CARDINAL MERCIER REPLIES</h4>

<p>Cardinal Mercier, Primate of Belgium, in behalf of the Belgian bishops,
issued a proclamation of protest on November 7, addressed to the neutral
nations and appealing for their aid in opposing the proceeding. His
protest is in these terms:</p>

<p>"The military authorities are daily deporting thousands of inoffensive
citizens in order to set them to forced labor.</p>

<p>"As early as October 19 we sent a protest to the governor-general, a
copy of which was also sent to the representatives of the Holy See in
Brussels, Spain, the United States, and the Netherlands. The
governor-general, in reply, refused to take any steps."</p>

<p>At Cartigny the Germans opened five vaults, each with a chapel above it,
by tearing apart the stones. They did the same thing at Ronsoy, at
Becquincourt, at Dompierre, at Bouvincourt, and at Herbecourt. At Nurly,
Roisel, Bernes, they even broke into coffins. In the enclosed ground
serving as a private cemetery for the Rohan family at Manancourt they
buried a great number of their soldiers, and, an inconceivable thing,
established a kitchen in the interior of the Rohan mausoleums and
latrines among their family tombs. In the crypt, where indescribable
disorder reigns, almost all the compartments are empty. A child's
coffin, taken from one of them, was stripped of its lead. A heavy leaden
casket, half drawn from another compartment, bears on its lid marks of a
chisel. A block of marble, in which is seen a small excavation, has been
thrown among the d&eacute;bris; it bears the inscription: "Here rests the heart
of Mme. Amelie de Musnier de Folleville, Countess of Boissy, who died at
Paris, July 16, 1830, at the age of thirty-two years and ten months."</p>

<p>The capture of two thousand prisoners by the Canadians is not
surprising, as the whole ridge was honeycombed with dugouts, in which
the Germans sheltered themselves.</p>

<p>Up to the present moment the great offensive had been held up just at
the point below the Canadian lines, which fact caused Vimy Ridge to be
styled the "hinge" of the enemy's retreat from the Somme, and the
Canadians have been very impatient for the "hinge" to move.</p>

infantry.</p>

<p>The enemy's a&euml;roplanes, which made desperate attempts to interfere, were
successfully engaged in many a&euml;rial fights and driven off with a loss of
three machines destroyed and at least four others damaged, while we lost
three.</p>

<p>At 6:20 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> on September 15, 1916, the
infantry assault commenced, and at the same moment the bombardment
became intense. Our new heavily armored cars, known as "tanks," now
brought into action for the first time, successfully co&ouml;perated
with the infantry, and, coming as a surprise to the enemy rank and file,
gave valuable help in breaking down their resistance.</p>

<p>The advance met with immediate success on almost the whole of the front
attacked. At 8:40 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> "tanks" were seen to
be entering Flers, followed by large numbers of troops. Fighting
continued in Flers for some time, but by 10 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>
our troops had reached the north side of the village, and by midday had
occupied the enemy's trenches for some distance beyond.</p>

and East Midland counties on Saturday night and early on Sunday morning,
but on their return journey the raiders numbered only 10.</p>

<p>The other two had been left behind in Essex. One was brought down in
flames not far from London, and its crew were all killed; the second
came to earth near the coast, and its crew of twenty-two surrendered.</p>

<p>Both the lost airships are big vessels of a new pattern.</p>

<p>On Sunday, October 8, the world was startled by the news that the U-53
was sinking British and neutral vessels near Nantucket Shoals Lightship,
a hundred miles from Newport, U. S. A., and leaving the crews and
passengers in small boats on the open sea. The underseas craft had
stationed itself in the steamer lane where nearly all incoming and
outgoing vessels from New York must pass, and its day's work consisted
in sending five ships to the bottom, as follows:</p>

<p>Under the title "The Devil's Chariot" the "D&uuml;sseldorfer
Generalanzeiger's" correspondent on the Western front describes the
British "tanks" and their effect on the astonished German soldiers. As
the German trench posts came out of their holes in the foggy dawn of
September 16 and raised heads again after the heavy iron-blows of the
night and looked toward the English, their blood froze in their veins as
two mysterious monsters came creeping over the crater fields.</p>

<p>The monster approached slowly, hobbling, moving from side to side,
rocking and pitching, but it came nearer. Nothing obstructed it; a
supernatural force seemed to drive it onwards. Some one in the trenches
cried "the devil comes," and that word ran down the line like lightning.
Suddenly tongues of fire licked out of the armored shine of the iron
caterpillar, shells whistled over our heads, and a terrible concert of
machine-gun orchestra filled the air. The mysterious creature had
surrendered its secret, and sense returned with it, and toughness and
defiance, as the English waves of infantry surged up behind the devil's
chariot.</p>

occupation. Sons, husbands, fathers, respectful of public order, bow to
their unhappy lot. With their most pressing needs provided for, they
await with dignity the end of their period of trial.</p>

<p>Now, suddenly, parties of soldiers begin to enter by force these
peaceful homes, tearing youth from parent, husband from wife, father
from children. They bar with the bayonet the door through which wives
and mothers wish to pass to say farewell to those departing. They herd
their captives in groups of tens and twenties and push them into cars.
As soon as the train is filled, the officer in charge brusquely waves
the signal for departure. Thus thousands of Belgians are being reduced
to slavery.</p>

<p>In this combination between infantry and artillery the Royal Flying
Corps played a highly important part. The admirable work of this corps
has been a very satisfactory feature of the battle. Under the conditions
of modern war the duties of the Air Service are many and varied. They
include the regulation and control of artillery fire by indicating
targets and observing and reporting the results of rounds; the taking of
photographs of enemy trenches, strong points, battery positions, and of
the effect of bombardments; and the observation of the movements of the
enemy behind his lines.</p>

<p>The greatest skill and daring has been shown in the performance of all
these duties, as well as in bombing expeditions. Our Air Service has
also co&ouml;operated with our infantry in their assaults, signaling the
position of our attacking troops and turning machine-guns upon the enemy
infantry and even upon his batteries in action.</p>

<p>The Germans announce the occupation of Bukharest. The evacuation of the
city was clearly imminent, and for some time past there has been little
hope that it could be saved. As a recent semi-official statement from
Bukharest intimated, the forts had been disarmed and the Rumanians never
intended to defend it if the field defences before it could not be held.</p>

<p>The capture of the strongly fortified position of Poivre Ridge was
decisive in its effect upon the fighting along the whole line. The ridge
was turned, and when the Germans, abandoning everything in their flight,
found their retreat cut off, they surrendered in hundreds.</p>

<p>The degree of savagery which the Germans have attained in their
submarine policy of sinking merchant-ships at sight would appear to have
reached its climax in the sinking of the British steam-ship
<i>Westminster</i>, proceeding in ballast from Torre dell' Annunziata to Port
Said. On December 14 this vessel was attacked by a German submarine,
without warning, when 180 miles from the nearest land, and struck by two
torpedoes in quick succession, which killed four men. She sank in four
minutes.</p>

<p>This ruthless disregard of the rules of international law was followed
by a deliberate attempt to murder the survivors. The officers and crew,
while effecting their escape from the sinking ship in boats, were
shelled by the submarine at a range of three thousand yards. The master
and chief engineer were killed outright and their boat sunk. The second
and third engineers and three of the crew were not picked up, and are
presumed to have been drowned.</p>

<p>Great Britain, in common with all other civilised nations, regards the
sinking without warning of merchant-ships with detestation.</p>

<p>Neutral ships which navigate the barred zones will do so at their own

are lying in harbors in the barred zones can with equal security still

case of suspicion&mdash;a remedy which they have never utilised.</p>

<p>From the German Government's statement that hospital ships will no

be drawn, namely, that it is the intention of the German Government to
add yet other and more unspeakable crimes against law and humanity to

<p>It is with sentiments of the most profound satisfaction that the peoples
of Great Britain and of the British Dominions across the seas have
learned that their great Ally Russia now stands with the nations which
base their institutions upon responsible government.</p>

<p>Much as we appreciate the loyal and steadfast co&ouml;peration which we have
received from the late Emperor and the armies of Russia during the past
two and a half years, yet I believe that the revolution whereby the
Russian people have based their destinies on the sure foundation of
freedom is the greatest service which they have yet made to the cause
for which the Allied peoples have been fighting since August, 1914.</p>

<p>It reveals the fundamental truth that this war is at bottom a struggle
for popular government as well as for liberty. It shows that through the
war, the principle of liberty, which is the only sure safeguard of peace
in the world, has already won one resounding victory. It is the sure
promise that the Prussian military autocracy which began the war, and
which is still the only barrier to peace, will itself before long be
overthrown.</p>

general financial support, and it is understood that Mexico is to
reconquer her lost territory of New Mexico, Texas, and Arizona. The
details are left to you for settlement.</p>

<p>You are instructed to inform the President of Mexico of the above in the

<p>Before retiring into the background the Executive Committee of the Duma,
under M. Rodzianko, issued on March 20 the following noteworthy appeal
to the nation:</p>

<p>A great event has happened. By one mighty effort the Russian people have
overthrown the old order of things. A new free Russia has been born. In
the course of nine long years all the rights won by the people were
taken away from it one by one. The country was once again thrown into
the abyss of arbitrariness and autocracy. All attempts to bring the
Government to reason proved fruitless, and the great world-war into
which our country was drawn by the enemy found it in a state of moral
disorganisation, with a Government separated from the people,
indifferent to the fate of the country, and sunk in the disgrace of
vices of every kind....</p>

<p>The people were obliged to take over the power in the State into their
own hands. The unanimous revolutionary impulse of the people, animated
by the sense of the importance of the hour, and the resoluteness of the
Duma, have created a Provisional Government which deems it to be its
sacred and responsible duty to realise the people's aspirations and to
lead the country on to the bright road of free civic organisation.</p>

has systematically pillaged and ravaged the evacuated zone, mostly
without reasons of a military nature. General von Fleck, the Commander
of the 17th German Army Corps, in leaving Ham carried away the furniture
of the house which he occupied in the town.</p>

<p>Germany never had the slightest intention of attacking the United States
of America, and does not intend to do so now. Germany never desired war
against the United States of America, and she does not desire it to-day.
How did things develop? We told the United States more than once that we
announced the unrestricted use of the submarine weapon in the
expectation that England could be made to observe in her blockade policy
the laws of humanity and international agreements.</p>

<p>If the American nation regards this as a reason for declaring war
against the German nation, with which it has lived in peace for more
than a hundred years; if by this action it wants to increase bloodshed,
not we shall have to bear the burden of responsibility for it. The
German nation, which feels neither hatred nor hostility towards the
United States of America, will also bear this and overcome it.</p>

extraordinary thought, wise counsel, calm and deliberate legislation;
that its resolves and all its enactments may spring spontaneously from
loyal and patriotic hearts; that our defenders on land and sea may be
amply supplied with the things which make for strength and efficiency.</p>

<p>We are now about to accept gage of battle with this natural foe to
liberty, and shall, if necessary, spend the whole force of the nation to
check and nullify its pretensions and its power. We are glad, now that
we see the facts with no veil of false pretense about them, to fight
thus for the ultimate peace of the peoples included: for the rights of
nations great and small and the privilege of men everywhere to choose
their way of life and of obedience. The world must be made safe for
democracy. Its peace must be planted upon the tested foundations of
political liberty. We have no selfish ends to serve. We desire no
conquest, no dominion. We seek no indemnities of ourselves, no material
compensation for the sacrifices we shall freely make. We are but one of
the champions of the rights of mankind. We shall be satisfied when those
rights have been made as secure as the faith and the freedom of nations
can make them.</p>

<p>There are, it may be, many months of fiery trial and sacrifice ahead of
us. It is a fearful thing to lead this great peaceful people into war,
into the most terrible and disastrous of all wars, civilization itself
seeming to be in the balance. But the right is more precious than peace,
and we shall fight for the things which we have always carried nearest
our hearts&mdash;for democracy, for the right of those who submit to
authority to have a voice in their own governments, for the rights and
liberties of small nations, for a universal dominion of right by such a
concert of free peoples as shall bring peace and safety to all nations
and make the world itself at last free. To such a task we can dedicate
our lives and our fortunes, everything that we are and everything that
we have, with the pride of those who know that the day has come when
America is privileged to spend her blood and her might for the
principles that gave her birth and happiness and the peace which she has
treasured. God helping her, she can do no other.</p>

fight for her defences and for the freedom of her people, it should, in
view of the conformity of the aims of the governments of the allies and
of the Russian Provisional Government, not be difficult to find a way
toward an understanding. This the less as the emperor (Charles) in
agreement with the allied monarchs cherishes the hope of living in
future in peace and friendship with a Russian people which, as regards
its internal and external conditions of life, will be secured and

machinery to shut off and up or look for unpleasant consequences.</p>

<p>These hidden-hangers do not come out in the open, even to the extent of
the semi-treasonable sentiments of the Pro-German Socialists at St.
Louis. If they did, it wouldn't be necessary to pay any attention to
them. They work in a more insidious way. Under the guise of American
citizenship they rise up every now and then, individuals or
organizations of doubtful origin and purpose, to demand why the United
States is in the war and what its intentions are....</p>

<p>Americans are in no mood to tolerate national sabotage of this sort any
more than plain and open aid and comfort to the enemy. Every man of
common sense knows why we are in the war and what we want to do. We are
in it because we were forced into it by outrageous aggressions and
because we are determined to make the world safe for American democracy.</p>

Perhaps the time is near when we will have to tell you that we can no

to freedom is not going on properly. We have tasted freedom and are
slightly intoxicated. What we need is sobriety and discipline.</p>

they fraternizing on the French front? No, comrades, if you are going to
fraternize, then fraternize everywhere. Are not enemy forces being
thrown over upon the Anglo-French front, and is not the Anglo-French
advance already stopped? There is no such thing as a "Russian front,"
there is only one general Allied front.</p>

has been able to announce that ten miles of the vaunted Hindenburg line
have passed into the possession of his gallant troops. The Germans say
that "there is no Hindenburg line," and in one respect at least they are
correct. Our Special Correspondent, in a despatch published in this
issue, declares that the Hindenburg line is "now undiscoverable." The
attacking forces gained possession of a very long stretch of pulverized
ground, but the line itself had been battered out of recognition.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Germany will not undertake an offensive so long as she
considers it possible to arrive at an understanding with
Russia. Numerous conversations with prominent politicians lead
me to believe that Germany is seeking to conclude with Russia a
mutually honorable peace, and a peace which would result in the
re-establishment of close economic and commercial relations
with Russia; the financial support of Germany to Russia for her
restoration; no intervention in the internal affairs of Russia;
a friendly understanding with regard to Poland, Lithuania, and
Courland; and the restoration to Russia of her occupied
territories, in return for the districts of Austria invaded by
Russia. I am convinced that if the allies of Russia desired it,
Germany and her allies would be ready immediately to open peace
negotiations."</p></div>

that we should be drawn into it, and we are vaguely conscious that we
are fighting their cause, as they will some day see it themselves, as

<p>My Fellow-Citizens: We meet to celebrate Flag Day because this flag
which we honor and under which we serve is the emblem of our unity, our
power, our thought, and purpose as a nation. It has no other character
than that which we give it from generation to generation. The choices
are ours. It floats in majestic silence above the hosts that execute
those choices, whether in peace or in war. And yet, though silent, it
speaks to us&mdash;speaks to us of the past, of the men and women who went
before us and of the records they wrote upon it. We are about to carry
it into battle, to lift it where it will draw the fire of our enemies.
We are about to bid thousands, hundreds of thousands, it may be
millions, of our men, the young, the strong, the capable men of the
nation, to go forth and die beneath it on fields of blood far away&mdash;for
what? For some unaccustomed thing? For something for which it has never
sought the fire before?</p>

<p>These are questions which must be answered. We are Americans. We in our
turn serve America, and can serve her with no private purpose. We must
use her flag as she has always used it. We are accountable at the bar of
history and must plead in utter frankness what purpose it is we seek to
serve.</p>

the police found nearly a ton of explosives of a very powerful variety.
Part of these explosives was made up to resemble coal briquettes, and
was all ready to be mixed with the coal in ships' bunkers. The baron's
luggage also contained cigarettes and tobacco mixed with carborundum,
which can be used to ruin engines or machinery. The baron and the other
arrested persons declare that the bombs and other explosives were to be

<p>Since the first day the war has been to us nothing but the defence of
our right to existence and freedom. Therefore we were able first and
alone to declare our readiness for peace negotiations. I spoke on July
9, 1915, and afterwards repeatedly with sufficient clearness on the
subject. Mr. Asquith and Lord Robert Cecil do not get rid of my words by
asserting that Germany had announced none, or only intolerable and
humiliating peace conditions. We did our part, nor does any one dare to
demand that we should make offers to-day when the enemy, as M. Briand
recently did, characterises the conclusion of peace to-day as weakness
for the memory of the dead. They continue the war because they hope to
be able to attain their Utopian war aims.</p>

shall, for the sake of neutral interest, restrict the use of an

demand would be incompatible with the character of neutrality, and the

<p>This is a conflict not of armies, but of industries and economic

win the war. The United States not only has the last &pound;100,000,000, but
it has many times &pound;100,000,000. The day that this country enters the war
the economic resources of the Allies will be doubled. We can practically
care for France while recruiting an army of our own. The German General
Staff may delude itself into believing that it has challenged the
immediate war-power of 100,000 men. What it is really challenging is a
war-power of 200,000,000,000 dollars (&pound;40,000,000,000) and a financial

<p>Seven Dutch Steamers which left Falmouth on February 22 were attacked
about 5 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> of the same day by a German submarine, without their papers
being examined. Three of the ships are known to have been sunk, one has
been towed into harbor, the other three, says a Lloyd's telegram, "might
still be afloat."</p>

<p>If the Dutch reports are correct that these seven vessels perished, this
will be deeply regretted, but responsibility for it falls on the
ship-owners, who preferred to send out their vessels on February 22 on a
promise of relative security instead of waiting until March 17, when
absolute security was promised. The report of the submarines has not yet
arrived.</p>

<p>We regret the rupture with a nation who, by her history, seemed to be
predestined to work together with us, not against us, for common ideals.
But since our honest desire for peace has only encountered hostile
ridicule on the part of our enemies, there is no more "going back," but
only "ahead" possible for us.</p>

<p>The revelation takes the form of a letter from Herr Zimmermann, the
German Foreign Secretary, to Eckardt, the German Minister in Mexico,
which was forwarded through Count Bernstorff and dated January 19. The
letter announces unrestricted submarine warfare for February first, and
instructs Eckardt to negotiate an offensive alliance with General
Carranza, who should approach Japan, apparently with the object
ultimately of getting her to join in an attack upon the United States.</p>

<p>According to the accounts of prisoners, formal orders had been given to

Democrats, he was able to communicate to the executive committee the
peace terms proposed by the official Social Democratic Party, i. e., the
majority section.</p>

<p>These, M. Borgbjerg proceeded, recognised the right of nations to
freedom of development, and advocated the introduction of compulsory
international arbitration; the restitution by Germany of all conquered
territories; a plebiscite in Russian Poland, with freedom to choose
between independence, annexation by Russia, or annexation by Germany;
the restoration of independence to Belgium, Serbia, and Rumania, and the
restoration to Bulgaria of the Bulgarian districts of Macedonia, and the
granting to Serbia of a free port on the Adriatic. As to
Alsace-Lorraine, they are of opinion that a rectification of the
Lorraine frontier could be secured by means of an amicable
understanding. The program of the minority section was wider in scope.</p>

<p>Does not the cartoonist Raemaekers fail in this cartoon? The artist
Raemaekers is inspired&mdash;here as always. But does the cartoonist succeed
this time in burning the right idea, his idea, into the reader's brain?</p>

<p>Here is the real Kaiser and here are real German workingmen. It is they
who are carrying the burden of Kaiserism. All this is convincing. But do
not other workingmen in other countries carry burdens?</p>

<p>The failure is only at first glance. Raemaekers is not concerned to
reproduce the conventional cartoon of workingmen carrying a burden of
other classes on their shoulders. The point lies not in the burden, but
in the nature of the burden, the contrast, so perfectly portrayed,
between the character of the Kaiser and the characters of his proud and
willing slaves. The Kaiser, crafty and contemptuous, but neither so
ignorant nor so stupid as to be wholly unconscious of the foolish and
contemptible position he occupies! The workingmen evidently once strong,
intelligent and enthusiastic, though now blinded and crippled, are
utterly unconscious of what they are doing. Carrying the heavy burden of
Kaiserism seems no more to them than their day's work.</p>

<p>You see Raemaekers knows both Kaiser and workingmen, and so will have
nothing to do with the conventional portraits of either. The Kaiser is
neither a beast nor a fool&mdash;however foolish his position may be. The
workingmen are neither labor heroes ready to revolt, nor conscious and
beaten serfs.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>In the inscription "Ten Million Men between 21 and 30" on the Statue of
Liberty, Raemaekers has as usual gone to the heart of things. Ten
million trained citizen soldiers!!! What an insurance of peace and
security against attack or insult. Universal Citizen Military Education
and Training.</p>

<p>From the beginning the first article in our Internat&iacute;onal Creed has been
the Monroe Doctrine&mdash;America for Americans. If the result of the present
war shall be to add two additional items to that creed, namely Universal
Military Education and Training, and the United States, the First Air
Power in the world, it will be worth all that it costs, and this great
nation can go on in peace and security to work out the mighty destiny
awaiting it.</p>

<p>Raemaekers' placing "All Highest" and his aide upon the conning tower of
a submarine, suggests another most vital matter at this present time.</p>

<p>The submarine has held the world's spotlight for the last two years. Its
deadly efficiency is universally conceded. That deadly efficiency is the
direct result of Admiral von Tirpitz's unyielding insistence on a
centralized, independent, untrammeled Department for the submarine.</p>

<p>The Prussian theory of right and justice is this: "What is mine is mine.
What is yours is also mine if I want it."</p>

<p>This idea is deep buried beneath the thick bone of the Prussian head. He
holds it with stolid stupidity and deep, prehistoric crudity, like a pig
or an idiot. He cannot understand that there are any rights higher than
Prussian greed. "If I want it, it is mine because I want it." It is the
logic of the primitive human animal, the caveman.</p>

<p>Cornered and accused of his thefts he clings to his loot like the pig
that has stolen a carrot. When asked to disgorge he is shocked by the
suggestion. "But they are mine! I wanted them, so they are mine!" he
says. Right and Justice answer, "They are not yours; you stole them."
"Maybe so!" says the Prussian. "But just the same they are mine&mdash;I stole
them a long time ago."</p>

<p>The logic of the Prussian fills ten thousand volumes. It is written in
hundred-line paragraphs and six-inch words. It can be condensed into two
short words&mdash;piggish greed; piggish because it knows neither right nor
justice, greed because it is greed.</p>

<p>It is Germany's "Kultur," her spiritual code, that is responsible for
America's entrance into the war; her gruesome sacrifice to Moloch of all
which distinguishes humanity from the brute and the savage. It is her
philosophy which has made us her horrified but resolute foe.</p>

<p>The fruits of her spirit stand forth alike in her speech and acts.
"Kultur is a spiritual organization of the world, which does not exclude
bloody savagery. It raises the d&aelig;moniac to sublimity. It is above
morality, reason, science," so wrote a Teutonic expounder in the first
year of the war. "We have become a nation of wrath; we think only of the
war. We execute God Almighty's will, and the edicts of His justice we
will fulfil, imbued with holy rage, in vengeance upon the ungodly. God
calls us to murderous battles, even if worlds should thereby fall to
ruins," so wrote one of Germany's poets. "Whoever cannot prevail upon
himself to approve from the bottom of his heart the sinking of the
<i>Lusitania</i>, whoever cannot conquer his sense of the gigantic cruelty to
unnumbered perfectly innocent victims&mdash;and give himself up to honest
delight at this victorious exploit of German defensive power&mdash;him we
judge to be no true German," so wrote one of her pastors. And for
hideous, ruthless deeds which violate every sanctity and deify falsehood
we need but cite her slaughter of children and the aged, her poisoning
of wells, her shooting of nurses, her sinking of hospital ships, her
brutal deportations and all the revolting sinuosities of her spy system.</p>

<p>Whether it is that an invigorating climate has given our Anglo-Saxon
blood a piquant Gallic flavor or because Europe sent us for ancestors
only those light-hearted and adventurous souls with a spirit akin to
that we admire in the French people, true it is that Americans have
always had an especial liking for France and the French. They were our
first allies as they are the latest. From Lafayette and Rochambeau to
Joffre and Viviani, a host of Frenchmen have won the affectionate regard
of Americans and are numbered with our national heroes.</p>

<p>With their French allies Americans can work in most cordial
understanding and sympathy. That subtle spirit of unselfish dedication
to country which has won for the French the admiration of the world
consecrates the alliance of the peoples who are giving their sons in
common sacrifice to save liberty to the world. Out of the heat and
turmoil of war bonds are being forged between the Allied nations which
time and circumstance can never sever. On that alliance the hope of
civilization depends; from it may come, in God's good time, some great
forward step in the march of progress which began at a manger in
Bethlehem.</p>

<p>If, as the artist suggests, and the plainest reading of the facts of the
fruitless Verdun assault seems to confirm, lives of men were squandered
in a reckless attempt to save the princeling's face (which was, in fact,
beyond saving), then does he richly deserve the grim decoration with
which in the name of infamy he is here invested&mdash;the Order of Butchery,
with knives. And you may view the crosses upon the pathetic mounds
before Verdun as so many entries in the Recording Angel's ledger.</p>

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is

     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>

     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.</li>

<li>You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>
</ul>

<p>1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from

Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.</p>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.</p>

<p>1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.</p>

<p>1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.</p>

<p>1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.</p>

<p>1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.</p>

<h3>Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

<h3>Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit <a
href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a></p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

<h3>Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:
<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a></p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
